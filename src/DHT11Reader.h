The following values are the number of read cycles to be executed to wait the responses from DHT11 sensor.
They are calculated as an approximation of an hypotetical high-speed IO's Arduino-based MCU (1us for complete 
the digitalRead operation). So, if a digitalRead operation is made, a reading cycle means that is passed 1us. If the
DHT11 send a pulse signal that has a certain duration (for example 50us), the MCU must execute 50 reading cycles.
Obviously. if the IO operation needs more time to be executed, the cycles will be the sames but it doesn't matter,
as this library is not made for critical missions.
